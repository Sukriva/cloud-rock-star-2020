# IBM Cloud :cloud: -  Become a Cloud Rock Star :star:

## Challenge guide Autum 2020

## Welcome to the first Mimmitcode virtual challange organized by IBM!

We are really excited that we have been offered the opportunity to lead this challenge. While the global situation does not currently allow for face-to-face workshops, we at IBM do not want this to become an obstacle. We still want to introduce this tremendous field with thousands of opportunities and trends. This time we offer an opportunity to take a peek into the world of Web Application.

Programming and code reading has become an important skill as the world digitalizes. The information is no longer distributed on paper but is read from various digital platforms. This is why the purpose of this Challenge is to lower the threshold and give the tools to set out to explore the wonderful world of web applications coding skills. In addition, as knowledge and skills grow, it often also raises innovation skills to develop new.

In this Challenge:

# INTRODUCTION

 - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
 - [Use Case](#use-case)
 - [Tools](#tools)
 - [Data](#data)
 - [Summary](#summary)
 
 1. First week you will setup application instance in IBM Cloud and check how to modify your application using Cloud tools.
 2. Second week you fetch data using Fetch API from two differenct data source.
 3. Third week you discover how to display fetched data in your application and how to modify page layout. You will also learn how to print a map. You have free hands with desining the page layout.
 4. Last week you will learn how to add functionality using JavaScript functions and style your application.
 
 We will give example code for every part so don't stress :blush:
 

## Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud account
  - Create a free account https://cloud.ibm.com
  
- Joined in Slack channel **#ibm-rockstar-beginner**
    - We will answer to questions and issues from there
  
  No previous coding experience is required. 
  

## Use Case

In this challenge, you'll learn how to create web application to IBM Cloud that uses two different data sources. Also, you will learn how to modify application using only Cloud tools. You will also learn how to print map using [Leaflet map](https://leafletjs.com) and add information to it from data source. You don't need to upload any tools or data for this to your laptop if you don't want to.


## Tools 

In this challenge, you'll use Cloud Foundry public environment from IBM Cloud to create application and Eclipse Orion Web IDE to modify the application. If you want you can use other programs for coding. We don't have instructions for those but we can help you from Slack channel :blush:

Good programs:
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)


### Data

This challenge uses [Explore Helsinki nature](https://citynature.eu/en/helsinki/) and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) data. Helsinki nature data has information about place names, webpage link and coordinates that we will use in the map we are adding to the application. Weather data we fecth current weather and forecast with information about temperature, description of the weather and print image of the description.


## Summary

Time to get started with the first week! Remember, Have Fun!
Go to [Week 1.1 - Build your first application](https://github.com/Sukriva/mimmitkoodaa-cloud-rock-star/tree/main/Week%201.1%20-%20Build%20your%20first%20application).
